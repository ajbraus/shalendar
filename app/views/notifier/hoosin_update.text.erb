hi awesome beta user!

First off, we apologize if we just sent you a deluge of 'connect' emails.. we just fixed the bug responsible for that.. thank you for your understanding :). Here's a quick overview of what's been up with hoos.in:

Mobile Apps

We have both Android and iPhone apps that are now ready for beta-use before they hit the market. We have 50 of each to distribute, check http://www.hoos.in for instructions to get one!

Train Car + Party

We moved into a new office inside a renovated train car and are throwing fun nightly activities open to our friends and users. Check out the site and follow our team (Adam Braus or Michael Fenchel) to stay up with them. A special thanks to everyone who came to Saturday's dance party! We had an absolute blast.

Blog + New Features

You can now add hoos.in plans to your google, iCal and Outlook Calendars! Just click the icons on the top right of any idea. We also put up a blog called "More Social, Less Network" about living a kick-ass social life in a busy technological world. Check it out, leave comments, and if you'd like to guest write let us know.

What's Next

All the feedback and use is still what's keeping us innovating and moving forward- please keep it coming. We have a bunch more features in the pipeline including a way for groups to easily split up costs for more expensive plans / tickets.

Have an Awesome Day!
