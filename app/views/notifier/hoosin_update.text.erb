hi awesome beta user!

First off, we apologize if you're getting a bunch of extra 'connect' emails.. it's an issue with our email service and we're working on fixing it. Thanks for your understanding :). Here's a quick overview of what's new with hoos.in:


hoos.in Mobile

You've asked for hoos.in on your phone, and it's finally here! We now have 75 beta iPhone apps we can distribute while we wait for Apple to let us in the iTunes store. We'll also be releasing a beta Android app within the next week. Check our post at hoos.in/blog for simple instructions on how to get the iPhone app before it hits the iTunes store.

Train Car / Dance Party

	
We moved into a new office inside a renovated train car and are throwing fun nightly activities open to our friends and users. Check out the site and follow our team (Adam Braus or Michael Fenchel) to stay up with them. A special thanks to everyone who came to Saturday's dance party! We had an absolute blast.

Blog + New Features

You can now add hoos.in plans to your google, iCal and Outlook Calendars! We also put up a blog called More Social, Less Network about living a kick-ass social life in a busy technological world. Check it out at hoos.in/blog, leave comments, and if you'd like to guest write let us know.


Have an Awesome Day!
