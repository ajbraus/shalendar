Hello, beautiful!

Thanks to you, a lot has happened since our last update. Here's a quick overview:


Mobile Apps

We have both Android and iPhone apps that are now ready for beta-use before they hit the market. We have 50 of each to distribute, check http://www.hoos.in for instructions to get one!

Train Car + Party

We moved into a new office inside a renovated train car that is pretty dang fun. We're throwing a party with music, drinks and a lot of great people this Saturday. Check out http://hoos.in/events/268 to join- and feel free to bring your friends!

New Features

You can now add hoos.in plans to your google, iCal and Outlook Calendars! We also got public ideas fixed up and added new idea options, and we just put up a blog at http://hoos.in/blog  about living a kick-ass social life in a busy technological world. Check it out, leave comments, and if you'd like to guest write let us know.

What's Next

All the feedback and use is still what's keeping us innovating and moving forward- please keep it coming. We have a bunch more features in the pipeline including a way for groups to easily split up costs for more expensive plans / tickets.

Have an Awesome Day!
