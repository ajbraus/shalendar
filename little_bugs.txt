BUGS

FOR LAUNCH
defaulting min and max is resetting it upon hitting event#edit

max = 0 creates this error "comparison of Fixnum with nil failed"

AFTER LAUNCH
maybe_events doesn't work with (full-calendar) scope calls on after, before

With notifier for event_noncritical_change, which means any update to event other than starts_at, it will send even if nothing was changed but the edit/update controller action was called...

double-creating events by hitting enter twice (when trying to specify duration)- all buttons
