BUGS

AFTER LAUNCH
maybe_events doesn't work with (full-calendar) scope calls on after, before

With notifier for event_noncritical_change, which means any update to event other than starts_at, it will send even if nothing was changed but the edit/update controller action was called...

double-creating events by hitting enter twice (when trying to specify duration)- all buttons

populating database is not creating because "Validating plan id is not there" (we solved this before by putting @event.save, and assigning an ID. I tried removing that and adding one and not the other.)

not getting events on calendar -- js errors - looks like something is wacky from some of our URL streams

home.html.erb - current user relationship list building to not count followed_id nil relationships, because when we're building one to fill in with form it's breaking otherwise
