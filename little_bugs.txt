maybe_events hack doesn't work with (full-calendar) scope calls on after, before

Don't know how to scope an event array, and need to figure out correct SQL calls. Refactor Event Filtering from Ruby->ActiveRecord
	Full + Tipped bool on events model

Don't know how to render the follow button using partials

Friends of friends is broken in the event controller viewing logic

max = 0 creates this error "comparison of Fixnum with nil failed"

Swapped day and month from Jquery datetime picker

google icon is tiny and squished

With notifier for event_noncritical_change, which means any update to event other than starts_at, it will send even if nothing was changed but the edit/update controller action was called... AND need to add to comment#create when we make that

If event is tipped once it can still untip- not currently notifying on that... do we want to allow it? or maybe up until 2 hours ahead of time?...


--------In event controller viewing logic
	doesn't show if somebody has made an event but un-RSVPd
	also, is adding event multiple times to JSON feed if more than one friend is RSVPd... does this matter?
