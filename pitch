the busy trap Tim Kreider (june 30th)

MOre friends than ever but less time to coordinate quality time together

Calenshare solves this problem

Simple and fast way to see what friends are up to and plan quality time

Leverage the calendar

Say what they'd like to do

Everyone ends up with calendar full of their network's ideas

Combining three key features in a way no other tool has

1. A relevant (curated) stream of social invitations displayed on a calendar similar to your feed of tweets on twitter or posts on your facebook wall.
2. A fluid decision making mechinism based on interest in each invitation similar to tipping on Groupon. A pick up game of basketball only happens if 10 ppl RSVP.
3. Interface for busy people - Full native, web, and mobile integration to interact and be reminded for events, including text message reminders.
