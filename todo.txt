	About, landing, and contact page -- landing page -> Have ideas for fun, share them on Calenshare with friends and friends of friends, have fun, rinse and repeat.

	Find Friends- the automatic redirect from Facebook should have some message if no friends are there, or at least a title to let ppl know where they land.

	"hidden features" - settings more clear, toggling, visibility, states of events unclear (tipped vs. untipped, idea vs. plan, idea vs. invitation )

AFTER BETA LAUNCH
	
	*Figure out how to get a pretty calendar*
		
		fullcalendar, event calendar, roll our own, ?
		maybe use lyconic's full calendar to get jquery tooltips and limit the number of events per day https://github.com/lyconic/fullcalendar/tree/jquery-ui-tooltip

	Invite only signup
	Get their city from facebook -- if not in our list, redirect to registration for invitation.
	Refactor event stream to use SQL rather than ruby
	google calendar "add this to calenshare"
	add fb events to calenshare
	Twitter & google (at least add contacts from google) (add an Authentications model and then connect all the users through this) 
	save image and access tokens in database and then update them upon login.
	Tests/refactoring
	Mobile dev
	SQL Table maintenance; mainly destroying events after they are done, but transferring data somewhere in a reasonable format for conducting analytics
	add recurring functionality
	Selectable
	log the access token upon sign_up and update upon sign_in. store picture URL as well.
	- custom url w title of the event. www.calenshare/AdamBraus/Hanging_at_my_house - http://railscasts.com/episodes/314-pretty-urls-with-friendlyid
	find friends in gmail, twitter
	Customize Calendar view
		1day, 4day, 2week
		add first day is always the left most day of four days. Probably need to add a dyanmic function to the firstDay call
	Detect user's local time with an ajax call to the browser and then log it in the session.
	copy evite
	Event search (w #tags)
	List view of events
	Groups/Lists of users ("Make selected viewed into list")
	Premium membership
		Paid event types
	Show on over details of day/event


LOW PRIORITY 

	Jammit
	default view of calendar 8am (set this?)
	overlay for event#show, event#edit
	Add google calendar socket - as 'busy'
	Map of all events? - hyperlocal NYC thing
	get FB events to show on shalendar
	refactor error messages as partial
	library of icons -flush out use cases -sports, games, booze, playdates, 
	Make focus fall on first text field on form


--------------------General ideas:----------------

More integration with facebook -- invitation creates facebook message . . . option to create facebook message / facebook event. In app app?

user experience of curating invites/groups - don't just select a new type of event
	"Make Current Selection a Group Users" "Invite Group to event"	

Monetization
	Individual deployments (cost based on user limit) (churches, frats, businesses) - pricing?
	Paid RSVPs
	############Premier accounts
	create Paid RSVPs subscription
	Logo icon on event
	preferred search
	personal calendar page (with customizable pretty header picture)

subdomains for every city - you can belong to multiple cities -- this strategy can be used for -- should we use heroku if we know our deployment strategy?

Marketing strategy
	private beta? 1001 ppl

NYC-inspired daily routine
	e.g. lunchtime email to gather ideas, 3pm to spread ideas, 6pm to tip

---------------------------------------------------



DONE

	review validations- event, user, etc.
	Recaptcha
	Comments on events
	Fullname upon signup
	profile pic helper method
	Invitation Events- email list per event + logic
