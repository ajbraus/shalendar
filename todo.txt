--------------------General ideas:----------------

user experience of curating invites/groups - don't just select a new type of event
	"Make Current Selection a Group Users" "Invite Group to event"	

Monetization
	Individual deployments (cost based on user limit) (churches, frats, businesses) - pricing?
	Paid RSVPs
	############Premier accounts
	create Paid RSVPs subscription
	Logo icon on event
	preferred search
	personal calendar page (with customizable pretty header picture)

	
Marketing strategy
	private beta? 1001 ppl

show details of daily events with this

$('.day').hover(function(){
	$(this).next('.dayDetails').show();
	},
	$(this).next('.dayDetails').hide();
});

$(.eventDetails).hide();
$('.event').hover(function(){
	$(this)next('.eventDetails').show();
	},
	$(this).next('eventDetails').hide();
});

overlay for new event form could be with a toggle call

$('new_event_button').toggle(function(){
	$(#new_event_form).show(); // with overlay jquery formatting
	},
	$(#new_event_form).hide();
)};


add qTip to event for deets

    eventRender: function(event, element) {
        element.qtip({
            content: event.description
        });
    }
