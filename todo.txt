Make sure events always get served in time order

	want to destroy events after they have passed... or at least destroy RSVPs / invitations, to maintain the tables- maybe store on some hard disk somewhere for records
 
	iPhone TODO:
		Settings / Confirm viewers (3)
		Create Event (3?)
		Native/local Register User (4?)
		Style (3-4)
		Views (3-4)
			Reload eventDetails after RSVP, display different on list

maps problem
	gmaps4rails - no scroll, default to satilight view                                                                
                      
Side note: put_wall_post posts to user/feeds, which doesn’t include a Share button. To get one when posting a link, you can use put_connections(user, “links”, hash_of_details)

P t to facebook wall . . . not for private events
post to rsvps facebook wall of friends of RSVPs
require city to join
require time_zone to join

Fixes
	troubleshoot signing in twice from facebook
	fix timezone
	all events already over turn grey
	If event is full, just not showing it in maybes right now - show as full
	Agent call - if android/iPhone download our apps	
	toggling faces on and off goes back to today and doesn't move the orange rectangle
	keyup character counter in idea
	Mobile local registration
	Recurring events
	Groups/Lists of users ("Make selected viewed into list")
	Flag user for spam (block/ignore user)


Features
	payment gateway
	public feed
	map view / list view / forecast built / 14 day forecast
	groups/lists
	checklist - easy to plan hard things to plan.

	What do we do with already finished events in a given day? - grey out the past
	Probably gray them out but still display? Or should we take them off the calendar as they're mostly irrelevant (but they still help for finding friends, make calendar more busy for better or worse)
	
	google calendar "add this to hoos.in".. and ADD THIS TO GoogleCal for rsvp'd events!

	See old plans/ideas and be able to easily 'resurface' them, with guests as invites (in lightbox or some other way than scrolling back in calendar)
	
	OldEvents model that holds events so that main searching doesn't have to handle larger array

Node Satisfaction:
	guest list

	

	SQL Table maintenance; mainly destroying events after they are done, but transferring data somewhere in a reasonable format for conducting analytics

	hide event/recurring event

	copy evite

	List view of events/ 3 week 5 week view of events calendar


LOW PRIORITY 

	Add google calendar socket - as 'busy'
	Map of all events? - hyperlocal NYC thing
	refactor error messages as partial
	library of icons -flush out use cases -sports, games, booze, playdates, 


--------------------General ideas:----------------

**IDeas from Jack: community + your events, display each in different sections. Give ppl 'credits', pay one to post any event, pay five for community event. Get points for a tipped event. Events around influential ppl. ----- Feed on right side of new event with other events of same type/tag. See other e.g. soccer games/camping trips. In 'didn't tip' notifier, send other ideas.

People set a price they're willing to pay- use to get group discounts on e.g. paintballing, rent a soccer field, rent equipment. could have ppl set a max, and tip on $ instead of ppl. Get enough ppl for hockey team, 'register a soccer team', 

Venues/resorts/... can put up events that only happen if they get enough interest, or that are cheaper based on how many ppl join and thus everyone going has incentive to tell people while the place is guaranteed to make money or have no costs!!!!

More integration with facebook -- invitation creates facebook message . . . option to create facebook message / facebook event. In app app?

user experience of curating invites/groups - don't just select a new type of event
	"Make Current Selection a Group Users" "Invite Group to event"	

** Thoughts from Eve Galanter ** LOTS OF FRIENDS THAT RUN EVENTS
	Madison Magazine, brava, inbusiness date books (calendars), Isthmus
	Monona terrace, alliant energy center
	public feed: *things to do with children as a subset/category- very appealing to young families
	Greater Madison convention and visitor's bureau- *Deb Archer*
		Want to see what it looks like
		not a lot of work - easy to put on events
		Understanding of what they already do, how it will enhance rather than detract
	Downtown Madison
	Greenway station, Museums, Arts community (overture)
	Nonprofit events- fundraising events
	Greek fest, Irish fest, German fest
	Isthmus would love to talk about it


Monetization
	Individual deployments (cost based on user limit) (churches, frats, businesses) - pricing?
	Paid RSVPs
	pay structure based on # of follows.
	############Premier accounts
	BRANDED EVENT#SHOW!! OR LINK TO THEIR SITE RATHER LOCAL
	create Paid RSVPs subscription
	Logo icon on event
	preferred search
	personal calendar page (with customizable pretty header picture)
	the link of event go to the event page
	branded event pages

subdomains for every city - you can belong to multiple cities -- this strategy can be used for -- should we use heroku if we know our deployment strategy?

Marketing strategy
	private beta? 1001 ppl

NYC-inspired daily routine
	e.g. lunchtime email to gather ideas, 3pm to spread ideas, 6pm to tip
