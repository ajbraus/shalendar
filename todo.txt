	remove yourself -- right now you can follow yourself

		Event#show
			display map_location
			make a scrollable grid (not a table) for guest raster


	calendar colors

	if event is private redirect to event, not calendar.

	Update follow/unfollow button to say "Requested" "Follow" "Unfollow"
	Manage follows -- pending follows, requested follows

	buy hughsin.com, change twitter handel, facebook page/app, google analytics, heroku
	add DNS to hughsin.com

	Blue

	Flash notices - no flash notices when hitting validations for new event. no flash notices when you have login troubles.	when unfollowing -- should double check or say undo, or flash that you unfollowed them.

	Post to facebook wall . . . not for private events. post to rsvps facebook wall of friends of RSVPs


	add fb events to calenshare

	About, landing, and contact page -- landing page -> Have ideas for fun, share them on Calenshare with friends and friends of friends, have fun, rinse and repeat.

		google icon is tiny and squished
		Notification views

	Add city to signup
	
	raster photo size

	Add fb to current login, add twitter etc. 



	"hidden features" - settings more clear, toggling, visibility, states of events unclear (tipped vs. untipped, idea vs. plan, idea vs. invitation )
 
	Scope some stuff like: 
                only: [:index, :edit, :update, :destroy, :following, :followers]


	Post to facebook wall . . . not for private events. post to rsvps facebook wall of friends of RSVPs

	add fb events to calenshare

	google calendar "add this to calenshare"


	"hidden features" - settings more clear, toggling, visibility, states of events unclear (tipped vs. untipped, idea vs. plan, idea vs. invitation )



	Fullcalendar vs. Eventcalendar (or other) (fixing too many events in one day, allowing our custom views and defaults) 

				maybe use lyconic's full calendar to get jquery tooltips and limit the number of events per day

				https://github.com/lyconic/fullcalendar/tree/jquery-ui-tooltip

			fullcalendar issues http://code.google.com/p/fullcalendar/issues/detail?id=837

	Views -
		

		Ajaxify everything
			follow/unfollow
			rsvp/unrsvp
			toggle/untoggle
			comments
			confirmations - remove follower, cancel account



	Add confirmations of follows - Make email, link from email to confirm_follow_path
	
	max = 0 creates this error "comparison of Fixnum with nil failed"

	

	Flag user for spam . . .?

	MIKE//////

	Run 'whenever --update-crontab *title*' from command line to make schedule.rb work, each time we change our cron jobs.

	Check through all notification stuff, make sure always sent and not double

	Go through all app logic; test (QA)

	friends_of_friends? is no longer a boolean so the logic of events needs to be fixed to reflect 'visibility'

	untipped events -- cancelling them 2 hours ahead
		
	Notifications
		Daily Digest - Day view list

	Event should only be able to tip once. Implement with tipped boolean?
		
		Deploy

		change friends of friends to friends of RSVPs in controller logic

		Chron job mailers for event changes (to fix lots of sends on drag/drop)

		PAIRED ////////
		



Only owners of events can edit events


AFTER LAUNCH
	

	Twitter & google (at least add contacts from google) (add an Authentications model and then connect all the users through this) 
	save image and access tokens in database and then update them upon login.
	Text messages for reminders to go to events your RSVPd to
	Tests/refactoring
	Mobile dev
	SQL Table maintenance; mainly destroying events after they are done, but transferring data somewhere in a reasonable format for conducting analytics
	add recurring functionality
	Selectable
	log the access token upon sign_up and update upon sign_in. store picture URL as well.
	- custom url w title of the event. www.calenshare/AdamBraus/Hanging_at_my_house - http://railscasts.com/episodes/314-pretty-urls-with-friendlyid
	find friends in gmail, twitter
	Customize Calendar view
		1day, 4day, 2week
		add first day is always the left most day of four days. Probably need to add a dyanmic function to the firstDay call
	Detect user's local time with an ajax call to the browser and then log it in the session.
	copy evite
	Event search (w #tags)
	List view of events
	Groups/Lists of users ("Make selected viewed into list")
	Primeum membership
		Paid event types
	Show on over details of day/event


LOW PRIORITY 

	Jammit
	default view of calendar 8am (set this?)
	overlay for event#show, event#edit
	Add google calendar socket - as 'busy'
	Map of all events? - hyperlocal NYC thing
	get FB events to show on shalendar
	refactor error messages as partial
	library of icons -flush out use cases -sports, games, booze, playdates, 
	Make focus fall on first text field on form


--------------------General ideas:----------------

More integration with facebook -- invitation creates facebook message . . . option to create facebook message / facebook event. In app app?

user experience of curating invites/groups - don't just select a new type of event
	"Make Current Selection a Group Users" "Invite Group to event"	

Monetization
	Individual deployments (cost based on user limit) (churches, frats, businesses) - pricing?
	Paid RSVPs
	############Premier accounts
	create Paid RSVPs subscription
	Logo icon on event
	preferred search
	personal calendar page (with customizable pretty header picture)

subdomains for every city - you can belong to multiple cities -- this strategy can be used for -- should we use heroku if we know our deployment strategy?

Marketing strategy
	private beta? 1001 ppl

NYC-inspired daily routine
	e.g. lunchtime email to gather ideas, 3pm to spread ideas, 6pm to tip

---------------------------------------------------



DONE

	review validations- event, user, etc.
	Recaptcha
	Comments on events
	Fullname upon signup
	profile pic helper method
	Invitation Events- email list per event + logic
