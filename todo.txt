Meetup API
Stripe payment gateway
Mobile .json server & serializer
Add payment gateway
	add account at price in event#form (require payment?)
	add kickstarter payments - pay 10$ ticket, 20$ t-shirt. 

events have many instances
  event#show show instance_rsvps progress bars
  create instance_rsvp button in event#show

  delete invitation after rsvp - if rsvpd => NO INVITATION

  create calendar view of rsvp_instances and invitation_instances
  	table with 4 rows of 7 squares

  use delayed jobs on deleting rsvp and instance_rsvp
    update invitations friends_in and intros_in

  When rsvp out of event, create Out
    delete invitation (loosing access to how many friends are going)
  when rsvp out of instance, create InstanceOut
    delete instance_invitation

  after relationships are created or destroyed sync invitations and all friends_in, intros_in

  idea happening only once, destroy all times except the first, server and client
  

invitation as polymorphic?
rsvp as polymorphic? (better code, slower queries)
