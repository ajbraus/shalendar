////////////////////Adam . . .

user search bar - jquery drop down - not auto complete, I need to actually see rendered @users that folks can follow.

be able to send size to fb_picture method small, medium, large, square.

Selectable

Jammit

Remove Drag/drop

Ajaxify everything
	follow/unfollow
	rsvp/unrsvp
	toggle/untoggle

log the access token upon sign_up and update upon sign_in. store picture URL as well.

defaulting min and max is resetting it upon hitting event#edit

no flash notices when hitting validations for new event.

custom url w title of the event.

Event#show
	display map_location
	make a scrollable grid (not a table) for guest raster

Make Koala pic large (https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/koala-users/dQHzoGAtr1o)

Friends of Friends button (click this for friends of RSVPs see this event)

JS
	add first day is always the left most day of four days. Probably need to add a dyanmic function to the firstDay call
	Make focus fall on first text field on form
	Selectable
	default view of calendar 8am (set this?)
	manage followers/following w tab page in a grid
	overlay for event#show, event#edit
	1day, 4day, 2week
	hover over friend raster and display full name

find friends in gmail, twitter

Add google calendar socket - as 'busy'

feedback button - to contact form

about, landing, and contact page -- landing page -> Have ideas for fun, share them on Calenshare with friends and friends of friends, have fun, rinse and repeat.

Detect user's local time with an ajax call to the browser and then log it in the session.

Google adsense on event#show - pay to get rid of


//////////////////Mike

INVITATIONS
	Invitations are like RSVPs, but rather than user->event, they're event->user
	Invitations really only matter because they make private events show up on certain followers' feeds... that plus they send an email notification. Do we allow invitations for non-private events (ostensibly to send the email)? Sending the email is good... but actually creating the invitation is a pain in the ass because then we have to filter it out of the maybes for it not to show up twice.

	Right now invitation logic is only fully working if they are only allowed for private events
	
	Still need to test invitations, and creating invitations from the view... which is a little tricky because we want to select a bunch of invitations and then do them all at once, rather than a one-time button with redirect like RSVP.



Add confirmations of follows

SQL Table maintenance; mainly destroying events after they are done, but transferring data somewhere in a reasonable format for conducting analytics

Add comments as belongs_to events in DB


////////////////////////////Paired

Mailers:
	Look into devise Mailchimp

Chron Jobs:
	Event Reminder 2 hrs ahead of time
	Tip by 2 hrs ahead of time (or by specified if e.g. young-prof NYC daily schedule)
	Daily Digest
		
	
	Invited notifications, all RSVPs (for invite events)

Implement the follow confirmation process
	Email with a link to confirm
	Store somewhere in DB


Fix Remove Follower Implementation

Invite and Public Events

FACEBOOK ////////////////////////

Signup wizard/find friends by location through facebook.
	log FB uid when they login
	Check FB uid against other users

FB Sign up logic:
	1. load all friends, 
	2. match on uid & provider in calenshare, 
	3. filter to location, 
	4. filter to not already following

Permissions for access_token on connect

Save FB image? because we are going to see that in the raster - cache it? it would be an HTTP request for each picture! too much.

//////////////////////////////


F T G - scan contacts for users to follow.

Tip by deadline - two hours ahead

subdomains for every city - you can belong to multiple cities -- this strategy can be used for -- should we use heroku if we know our deployment strategy?

text notifications (1 cent per text)

***** Suggestions from Jesse

Map of all events? - hyperlocal NYC thing

dialogue in event#show

tags

Very appealing single-day view

Google Alerts style notifications - different options

copy evite


--------------------General ideas:----------------

user experience of curating invites/groups - don't just select a new type of event
	"Make Current Selection a Group Users" "Invite Group to event"	

Monetization
	Individual deployments (cost based on user limit) (churches, frats, businesses) - pricing?
	Paid RSVPs
	############Premier accounts
	create Paid RSVPs subscription
	Logo icon on event
	preferred search
	personal calendar page (with customizable pretty header picture)

	
Marketing strategy
	private beta? 1001 ppl

NYC-inspired daily routine
	e.g. lunchtime email to gather ideas, 3pm to spread ideas, 6pm to tip

---------------------------------------------------


get FB events to show on shalendar

refactor error messages as partial

Lists + Invite Events 

security: recaptcha

add all day boolean

add recurring functionality


library of icons -flush out use cases -sports, games, booze, playdates, 

event types - public, follows, invitation, paid

show details of daily events with this

$(.dayDetails).hide();

$('.day').hover(function(){
	$(this).next('.dayDetails').show();
	},
	$(this).next('.dayDetails').hide();
});

$(.eventDetails).hide();
$('.event').hover(function(){
	$(this)next('.eventDetails').show();
	},
	$(this).next('eventDetails').hide();
});

overlay for new event form could be with a toggle call

$('new_event_button').toggle(function(){
	$(#new_event_form).show(); // with overlay jquery formatting
	},
	$(#new_event_form).hide();
)};


add qTip to event for deets

http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/docs/event_rendering/eventRender/

    eventRender: function(event, element) {
        element.qtip({
            content: event.description
        });
    }


maybe use lyconic's full calendar to get jquery tooltips and limit the number of events per day
