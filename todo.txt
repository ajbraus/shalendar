	API documentation + Mobile Models for Jeff
	Re-factor API event loading for speed + clarity
	Prune ins may not be working for canceled ideas (check)
	"Add Friend" improvement to mobile
	add 'invite_only?' (event.visiblity == 0)
		(I created three event methods - open_invite?, friends_only?, and invite_only?
		so all your event.friends_only? code should work, but we need additions of invite_only? 
		code to prevent some notifications)

	bug:
		make two times for an idea 
		seeing out in invites
		ignore not removing user ajaxy
		show creator of idea
		interested - blue when click
		out - red when click
		edit - make idea one_time

	reload instead of ajax for each - home is show, else .invites, interested, ins. Just links! - then pagination is easy as fuck!

	vote on times

	workless - realtime worker

	emails to 
		- iphone app users - to write a review
		- rockstars
		- never created an idea yet (but have intros)
		- no .intros

  when event name chagnes getting two notifications, two comments
	allow in/out from emails
	tagging user

----------------------------------------------------------------------

	meetup signin/events

	fb page signin/events
		add your facebook pages ideas to hoos.in
		added link with 'manage_pages' permissions
		create they're user and authentication and login
		if there is pages data
			have them select which account they would like to sync with hoos.in?
		for each create a new user and authentication and pull in all there events
			:user has_many :accounts class: "User" 
		every time anyone logs in, check if they have accounts, if they do try to update all events on a background job.

	when creating fb event only join existing if an intros is in

	.intros .invite - 
		DONE created route, controller method, notifier method, and template
		email field (need the api link call in the email with the inviter's id)
		added to send all emails
		- email not working
	starred .intro invitations 15
		hoos.in is for doing things with your real friends
		.invite 15 of your friends in your city to be your .intros on hoos.in
	
	host out stats

	don't destroy users, just mark them as 'unregistered = true' and remove them from any user queries.
	
	in all emails make a user's name and picture go to their home page
	change self.digest to use invitations
	intros counts are not accurate on digest (event_details)
	put new inmates into digest

	pass in UID to facebook send dialogue?
	app request diaglog

	add face when rsvping

	New Idea tutorial after register

	refactor EmailInvite code in api code


	what are you up to tonight? - if someone views your profile and they are you're .intro shouldn't it show them?
	check in somewhere on foursquare through hoos.in - creates an idea at that location

HI SDK
Send idea global unique identifier
Check if any inmates are in on the idea's identifier
If yes in them on the most socially relevant
Else have them create a duplicate of the idea
