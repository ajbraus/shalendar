	Blue
	
	  User search bar
		also in manage follow page


	Fullcalendar vs. Eventcalendar (or other) (fixing too many events in one day, allowing our custom views and defaults) 

				maybe use lyconic's full calendar to get jquery tooltips and limit the number of events per day

		google icon is tiny and squished
		invitations- email entering + select from raster + maybe select from FB friends

			comments


		Event#show
			display map_location
			make a scrollable grid (not a table) for guest raster

	max = 0 creates this error "comparison of Fixnum with nil failed"

	Post to facebook wall . . . not for private events.

	library of icons -flush out use cases -sports, games, booze, playdates,

--------------------General ideas:----------------

More integration with facebook -- invitation creates facebook message . . . option to create facebook message / facebook event. In app app?

user experience of curating invites/groups - don't just select a new type of event
	"Make Current Selection a Group Users" "Invite Group to event"	

Monetization
	Individual deployments (cost based on user limit) (churches, frats, businesses) - pricing?
	Paid RSVPs
	############Premier accounts
	create Paid RSVPs subscription
	Logo icon on event
	preferred search
	personal calendar page (with customizable pretty header picture)

subdomains for every city - you can belong to multiple cities -- this strategy can be used for -- should we use heroku if we know our deployment strategy?

Marketing strategy
	private beta? 1001 ppl

NYC-inspired daily routine
	e.g. lunchtime email to gather ideas, 3pm to spread ideas, 6pm to tip

---------------------------------------------------



DONE

	review validations- event, user, etc.
	Recaptcha
