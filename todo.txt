12/12 Push

HEADER:
30 px spacing next to icon + picture. switch city to left header, .interests in middle, friends left-middle, .instructions to right

Sidebar should be persistent in event#show, really everywhere
Friend button in search and update .interests button too small

Manage friends is wonky, should be over to right so sidebar can be seen

.invites bar isn't working

invite all doesn't invite ppl from different cities- do we want to confirm city switch? it can get confusing if you don't realize you've switched (happened to me)

ends_at behaving weird for events

Event update takes forever in production

make chat bar go across the whole width of event#show
(blue circle new idea) is to the right of the number, rather than the left.

Adam todo from 11/12 meeting:

week of 11/12
	venue dashboard (activity)
	branded event page
	payment gateway (not worrying about tipping)

week of 11/19
	Link + image that venues can embed for hoos.in
	ticketing solution (just give names for now..)

*** adding facebook after already have an account doesn't seem to work
** have to double click all buttons with tooltips when from mobile

Also, mobile registration through facebook doesn't seem to work either, let's pair on this.

hi,

Over the past two months, Mike and I have been listening to your suggestions and now we are proud to say we've listend and have just released a new version full of enhancements. Here they are:

1) City-Wide Ideas - Post ideas to your whole city! We decided that pretty much anyone has something to share with their city, so you can now choose to post "Public" ideas 

2) Iphone and Andorid apps in app stores -- search 'hoosin'

3) hoos.in? You are! - Your own profile page with your past ideas, and stats. For privacy your upcoming ideas are only visible to invites.

3.5) Custom Background - Now you can have your own custom background for your events and profile. Just click on your face in the upper right hand corner, select "Settings", and upload a large image (at least 1024x640 recommended) to the "Background" field.

4) Better sharing - Share hoosin ideas on twitter, facebook, pinterest, by email and (on mobile) by text.

5) New Look - New layout with Vertical Scroll and More Days. Now you get 26 days of hoos.in ideas, and you can scroll vertically between them all.

--------------------General ideas:----------------

**IDeas from Jack: community + your events, display each in different sections. Give ppl 'credits', pay one to post any event, pay five for community event. Get points for a tipped event. Events around influential ppl. ----- Feed on right side of new event with other events of same type/tag. See other e.g. soccer games/camping trips. In 'didn't tip' notifier, send other ideas.

People set a price they're willing to pay- use to get group discounts on e.g. paintballing, rent a soccer field, rent equipment. could have ppl set a max, and tip on $ instead of ppl. Get enough ppl for hockey team, 'register a soccer team', 

Venues/resorts/... can put up events that only happen if they get enough interest, or that are cheaper based on how many ppl join and thus everyone going has incentive to tell people while the place is guaranteed to make money or have no costs!!!!

More integration with facebook -- invitation creates facebook message . . . option to create facebook message / facebook event. In app app?

user experience of curating invites/groups - don't just select a new type of event
	"Make Current Selection a Group Users" "Invite Group to event"	

** Thoughts from Eve Galanter ** LOTS OF FRIENDS THAT RUN EVENTS
	Madison Magazine, brava, inbusiness date books (calendars), Isthmus
	Monona terrace, alliant energy center
	public feed: *things to do with children as a subset/category- very appealing to young families
	Greater Madison convention and visitor's bureau- *Deb Archer*
		Want to see what it looks like
		not a lot of work - easy to put on events
		Understanding of what they already do, how it will enhance rather than detract
	Downtown Madison
	Greenway station, Museums, Arts community (overture)
	Nonprofit events- fundraising events
	Greek fest, Irish fest, German fest
	Isthmus would love to talk about it


Monetization
	Individual deployments (cost based on user limit) (churches, frats, businesses) - pricing?
	Paid RSVPs
	pay structure based on # of follows.
	############Premier accounts
	BRANDED EVENT#SHOW!! OR LINK TO THEIR SITE RATHER LOCAL
	create Paid RSVPs subscription
	Logo icon on event
	preferred search
	personal calendar page (with customizable pretty header picture)
	the link of event go to the event page
	branded event pages

subdomains for every city - you can belong to multiple cities -- this strategy can be used for -- should we use heroku if we know our deployment strategy?

Marketing strategy
	private beta? 1001 ppl

NYC-inspired daily routine
	e.g. lunchtime email to gather ideas, 3pm to spread ideas, 6pm to tip
