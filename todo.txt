iPhone 

	needs before release:
		all images done
		testing push notifications, error messages, ...

Design coherence

Fix so sending push notifications better than every 10 minutes (after creating, check some counter, then run the task)

GCM push testing

Some guests_can_invite_friends bool are nil, wtf?

Click someone's face to find their friends too

	Auto-scale workers

store and remove old emailInvites and invitations

new follower email link not working

	want to destroy events after they have passed... or at least destroy RSVPs / invitations, to maintain the tables- maybe store on some hard disk somewhere for records
 
	iPhone TODO:
		Settings / Confirm viewers (3)
		Native/local Register User (4?)
		Style (3-4)
		Check load delays with broadband

		Make it look like Pinterest
			Make back arrow.
			Box shadow on corners of images
			swipe between days
			make top and bottom nav bars disappear when you scroll
		Comments
		Delete events
		Suggestions

	What do we do with already finished events in a given day? - grey out the past
	Probably gray them out but still display? Or should we take them off the calendar as they're mostly irrelevant (but they still help for finding friends, make calendar more busy for better or worse)
	
	google calendar "add this to hoos.in".. and ADD THIS TO GoogleCal for rsvp'd events!

--------------------General ideas:----------------

**IDeas from Jack: community + your events, display each in different sections. Give ppl 'credits', pay one to post any event, pay five for community event. Get points for a tipped event. Events around influential ppl. ----- Feed on right side of new event with other events of same type/tag. See other e.g. soccer games/camping trips. In 'didn't tip' notifier, send other ideas.

People set a price they're willing to pay- use to get group discounts on e.g. paintballing, rent a soccer field, rent equipment. could have ppl set a max, and tip on $ instead of ppl. Get enough ppl for hockey team, 'register a soccer team', 

Venues/resorts/... can put up events that only happen if they get enough interest, or that are cheaper based on how many ppl join and thus everyone going has incentive to tell people while the place is guaranteed to make money or have no costs!!!!

More integration with facebook -- invitation creates facebook message . . . option to create facebook message / facebook event. In app app?

user experience of curating invites/groups - don't just select a new type of event
	"Make Current Selection a Group Users" "Invite Group to event"	

** Thoughts from Eve Galanter ** LOTS OF FRIENDS THAT RUN EVENTS
	Madison Magazine, brava, inbusiness date books (calendars), Isthmus
	Monona terrace, alliant energy center
	public feed: *things to do with children as a subset/category- very appealing to young families
	Greater Madison convention and visitor's bureau- *Deb Archer*
		Want to see what it looks like
		not a lot of work - easy to put on events
		Understanding of what they already do, how it will enhance rather than detract
	Downtown Madison
	Greenway station, Museums, Arts community (overture)
	Nonprofit events- fundraising events
	Greek fest, Irish fest, German fest
	Isthmus would love to talk about it


Monetization
	Individual deployments (cost based on user limit) (churches, frats, businesses) - pricing?
	Paid RSVPs
	pay structure based on # of follows.
	############Premier accounts
	BRANDED EVENT#SHOW!! OR LINK TO THEIR SITE RATHER LOCAL
	create Paid RSVPs subscription
	Logo icon on event
	preferred search
	personal calendar page (with customizable pretty header picture)
	the link of event go to the event page
	branded event pages

subdomains for every city - you can belong to multiple cities -- this strategy can be used for -- should we use heroku if we know our deployment strategy?

Marketing strategy
	private beta? 1001 ppl

NYC-inspired daily routine
	e.g. lunchtime email to gather ideas, 3pm to spread ideas, 6pm to tip
