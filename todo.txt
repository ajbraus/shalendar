To do
Paired
---------
Input starts_at to account for timezone (chronic, ...)
Input a user's correct timezone (probably on registration.. but how do we get from FB?)

wednesday - add hoos.in domain to heroku

Time Zones are causing the event-by-day logic to be off (starts_at is reading from UTC 0, not offset by 500 even though it knows that is there)
Make sure events always get served in time order
	see: http://databasically.com/2010/10/22/what-time-is-it-or-handling-timezones-in-rails/

Cron jobs environment set to production, don't know how to change, but still getting some output (pg_dump and also Event.check_tip_deadlines executing when dev server running.) - heroku scheduler
	want to destroy events after they have passed... or at least destroy RSVPs / invitations, to maintain the tables- maybe store on some hard disk somewhere for records

Landing page, about, contact

	iPhone TODO:
		Settings / Confirm viewers (3)
		Create Event (3?)
		Native/local Register User (4?)
		Style (3-4)
		Views (3-4)
			Reload eventDetails after RSVP, display different on list 
			Make sure can click through to event details more than once
			Refresh button to reload event list
			Toggling display, not just hide (bc takes up space)
		Times (4)

fix cloud/rsvp thing

event#edit

ajax bugs

	toggling faces on and off goes back to today and doesn't move the orange rectangle

	in manage follows, after viewing someone it switches back tabs to following (when ajax not working)

	view from search button not changing to viewed until close search window

	FIX rsvp/unrsvp
	
	visual indicator if invitation sent in find_friends
		
view request crowds stats

Only showing events that start on the day... don't know what to do for longer than 1-day things... but not really core - test

double-creating events by hitting enter twice (when trying to specify duration)- all buttons

maps problem
	gmaps4rails - no scroll, default to satilight view 45dgs

/300 followers

settings dropdown/icon

Add logo to Post to FB wall - Adam

--------------------General ideas:----------------

**IDeas from Jack: community + your events, display each in different sections. Give ppl 'credits', pay one to post any event, pay five for community event. Get points for a tipped event. Events around influential ppl. ----- Feed on right side of new event with other events of same type/tag. See other e.g. soccer games/camping trips. In 'didn't tip' notifier, send other ideas.

People set a price they're willing to pay- use to get group discounts on e.g. paintballing, rent a soccer field, rent equipment. could have ppl set a max, and tip on $ instead of ppl. Get enough ppl for hockey team, 'register a soccer team', 

Venues/resorts/... can put up events that only happen if they get enough interest, or that are cheaper based on how many ppl join and thus everyone going has incentive to tell people while the place is guaranteed to make money or have no costs!!!!

More integration with facebook -- invitation creates facebook message . . . option to create facebook message / facebook event. In app app?

user experience of curating invites/groups - don't just select a new type of event
	"Make Current Selection a Group Users" "Invite Group to event"	

** Thoughts from Eve Galanter ** LOTS OF FRIENDS THAT RUN EVENTS
	Madison Magazine, brava, inbusiness date books (calendars), Isthmus
	Monona terrace, alliant energy center
	public feed: *things to do with children as a subset/category- very appealing to young families
	Greater Madison convention and visitor's bureau- *Deb Archer*
		Want to see what it looks like
		not a lot of work - easy to put on events
		Understanding of what they already do, how it will enhance rather than detract
	Downtown Madison
	Greenway station, Museums, Arts community (overture)
	Nonprofit events- fundraising events
	Greek fest, Irish fest, German fest
	Isthmus would love to talk about it


Monetization
	Individual deployments (cost based on user limit) (churches, frats, businesses) - pricing?
	Paid RSVPs
	pay structure based on # of follows.
	############Premier accounts
	BRANDED EVENT#SHOW!! OR LINK TO THEIR SITE RATHER LOCAL
	create Paid RSVPs subscription
	Logo icon on event
	preferred search
	personal calendar page (with customizable pretty header picture)
	the link of event go to the event page
	branded event pages

subdomains for every city - you can belong to multiple cities -- this strategy can be used for -- should we use heroku if we know our deployment strategy?

Marketing strategy
	private beta? 1001 ppl

NYC-inspired daily routine
	e.g. lunchtime email to gather ideas, 3pm to spread ideas, 6pm to tip
