FOR LAUNCH


	ADAM//////
	User search bar
		also in manage follow page

	Fullcalendar vs. Eventcalendar (or other) (fixing too many events in one day, allowing our custom views and defaults) 

				maybe use lyconic's full calendar to get jquery tooltips and limit the number of events per day

				https://github.com/lyconic/fullcalendar/tree/jquery-ui-tooltip

			fullcalendar issues http://code.google.com/p/fullcalendar/issues/detail?id=837

	review validations- event, user, etc.
	feedback button - to contact form
	Add comments as belongs_to events in DB (asynchronous)
	Mailers formatted

	Settings form for notification settings

	when unfollowing -- should double check or say undo, or flash that you unfollowed them.

	Views -
		Flash notices - no flash notices when hitting validations for new event. no flash notices when you have login troubles
		fb_picture sizes - https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/koala-users/dQHzoGAtr1o)
		Blue
		Fullname upon signup
		hover over friend raster and display full name
		Make focus fall on first text field on form
		About, landing, and contact page -- landing page -> Have ideas for fun, share them on Calenshare with friends and friends of friends, have fun, rinse and repeat.
		google icon is tiny and squished
		invitations- email entering + select from raster + maybe select from FB friends


		Ajaxify everything
			follow/unfollow
			rsvp/unrsvp
			toggle/untoggle

		recaptcha security

		Event#show
			display map_location
			make a scrollable grid (not a table) for guest raster


	defaulting min and max is resetting it upon hitting event#edit
		Take out defaulting from db?
	max = 0 creates this error "comparison of Fixnum with nil failed"

	MIKE//////

		Invitation Events- email list per event + logic
		Add confirmations of follows
		untipped events -- cancelling them 2 hours ahead

	custom url w title of the event. www.calenshare/AdamBraus/Hanging_at_my_house
	find friends in gmail, twitter
	Customize Calendar view
		1day, 4day, 2week

	Jammit
	default view of calendar 8am (set this?)
	overlay for event#show, event#edit
	Add google calendar socket - as 'busy'

	get FB events to show on shalendar
	refactor error messages as partial
	library of icons -flush out use cases -sports, games, booze, playdates, 



--------------------General ideas:----------------

user experience of curating invites/groups - don't just select a new type of event
	"Make Current Selection a Group Users" "Invite Group to event"	

Monetization
	Individual deployments (cost based on user limit) (churches, frats, businesses) - pricing?
	Paid RSVPs
	############Premier accounts
	create Paid RSVPs subscription
	Logo icon on event
	preferred search
	personal calendar page (with customizable pretty header picture)

subdomains for every city - you can belong to multiple cities -- this strategy can be used for -- should we use heroku if we know our deployment strategy?

Marketing strategy
	private beta? 1001 ppl

NYC-inspired daily routine
	e.g. lunchtime email to gather ideas, 3pm to spread ideas, 6pm to tip
