	Font
	Images:
		Tipped 
		untipped
		morning/afternoon/evening

	ADAM//////

	invite friends to calenshare

	idea click lightbox

	remove city

	name hover raster

	"hidden features" -  
		visibility - target icon, states of events unclear (tipped vs. untipped, idea vs. plan, idea vs. invitation ) legend

	Event#show
		display map_location
		map bug -google.maps.event.trigger(map, 'resize');
		modernizr?
		make a scrollable grid (not a table) for guest raster

	calendar colors

	if event is private redirect to event, not calendar.

	Flash notices - no flash notices when hitting validations for new event. no flash notices when you have login troubles.	when unfollowing -- should double check or say undo, or flash that you unfollowed them.

	Notification views

	comments screwed up

	expiring facebook tokens
	
	autocomplete on name

	Make native login play nice with FB, be able to use either/both

	requested on stats, settings page, manage page isn't working perfectly (viewers you are not following have no view button)

	invites list had duplicates and unconfirmed followers showing up.

	add Jquery validations for search

	follow someone with the autocomplete that you are already following -- sql error
	SQLite3::ConstraintException: constraint failed: INSERT INTO "relationships" ("confirmed", "created_at", "followed_id", "follower_id", "toggled", "updated_at") VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)

	don't auto-complete completely and enter garbage into the field error

	remove yourself -- right now you can follow yourself

AFTER BETA LAUNCH
	

	Twilio:
		add phone number to user in DB
		add SMS messages to notifier
		Buy phone number
		add phone number in settings page
		add user boolean for receiving text messages

		Ajaxify everything
			follow/unfollow
			rsvp/unrsvp
			toggle/untoggle
			comments
			confirmations - remove follower, cancel account

	Recurring events

	Invite only signup

	Get their city from facebook -- if not in our list, redirect to registration for invitation.
	
	google calendar "add this to calenshare"

	save image and access tokens in database and then update them upon login.

	Tests/refactoring
	
	SQL Table maintenance; mainly destroying events after they are done, but transferring data somewhere in a reasonable format for conducting analytics
	add recurring functionality

	Selectable

	log the access token upon sign_up and update upon sign_in. store picture URL as well.

	- custom url w title of the event. www.calenshare/AdamBraus/Hanging_at_my_house - http://railscasts.com/episodes/314-pretty-urls-with-friendlyid

	find friends in gmail, twitter

	Detect user's local time with an ajax call to the browser and then log it in the session.

	copy evite

	Event search (w #tags)
	List view of events
	Groups/Lists of users ("Make selected viewed into list")
	Premium membership
		Paid event types
		make CS event - FB event
	Show on over details of day/event


LOW PRIORITY 

	Jammit
	default view of calendar 8am (set this?)
	overlay for event#show, event#edit
	Add google calendar socket - as 'busy'
	Map of all events? - hyperlocal NYC thing
	get FB events to show on shalendar
	refactor error messages as partial
	library of icons -flush out use cases -sports, games, booze, playdates, 
	Make focus fall on first text field on form


--------------------General ideas:----------------

More integration with facebook -- invitation creates facebook message . . . option to create facebook message / facebook event. In app app?

user experience of curating invites/groups - don't just select a new type of event
	"Make Current Selection a Group Users" "Invite Group to event"	

Monetization
	Individual deployments (cost based on user limit) (churches, frats, businesses) - pricing?
	Paid RSVPs
	############Premier accounts
	create Paid RSVPs subscription
	Logo icon on event
	preferred search
	personal calendar page (with customizable pretty header picture)

subdomains for every city - you can belong to multiple cities -- this strategy can be used for -- should we use heroku if we know our deployment strategy?

Marketing strategy
	private beta? 1001 ppl

NYC-inspired daily routine
	e.g. lunchtime email to gather ideas, 3pm to spread ideas, 6pm to tip

---------------------------------------------------
