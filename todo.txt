////////////////////Alone . . .

user search bar - jquery drop down - not auto complete, I need to actually see rendered @users that folks can follow.

Selectable

Jammit

Rails alerts after event drag drop update.

Ajaxify everything
	follow/unfollow
	rsvp/unrsvp
	toggle/untoggle

remove power to drag and drop other ppl's events

defaulting min and max is resetting it upon hitting event#edit

no flash notices when hitting validations for new event.

custom url w title of the event.
	www.calenshare/AdamBraus/Hanging_at_my_house

get mike verified and deploy to calensha.re with zerigo.

heroku addons:add zerigo_dns:basic --app warm-samurai-8582

Event#new
	Title, Starts_at (chronic), duration, min, max, invite friends of friends?
	calculate ends_at from duration (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/238684/subtract-n-hours-from-a-datetime-in-ruby)

Event#show
	display map_location
	make a grid (not a table) for guest raster

Make Koala pic large (https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/koala-users/dQHzoGAtr1o)

Friends of Friends button (click this for friends of RSVPs see this event)

JS
	add first day is always the left most day of four days. Probably need to add a dyanmic function to the firstDay call
	Make focus fall on first text field on form
	Click on calendar to event
	default view of calendar 8am (set this?)
	manage followers/following w tab page in a grid
	overlay for event#show, event#edit
	1day, 4day, 2week
	hover over friend raster and display full name

find friends in gmail, twitter, and facebook contacts.

Add google calendar socket - as 'busy'

feedback button - to contact form

about, landing, and contact page -- landing page -> share events, manage who, what, where and when quickly and dynamically, invite friends of friends

Detect user's local time with an ajax call to the browser and then log it in the session.

Google adsense on event#show - pay to get rid of


////////////////////////////Paired

Mailers - 
	Welcome to Shalendar - all users, Registration#create
	Event Cancellation - all RSVPs, Event#destroy

		User Settings -
	Confirmation of follow notification - one follow, Relationship#create
	Event Tipped! all RSVPs, RSVP#create 
	1 day, 3 day Digest - all users, daily cron job
	Event Update, all RSVPs, Event#update
	New comment in Event conversation, all RSVPs, Comment#create
	


	RSVP Reminders, all RSVPs
	(tipping cron job), use devise_mailchimp :o)

Remove Follower Implementation

Add confirmations for follows (and user settings page)


FACEBOOK ////////////////////////

Signup wizard/find friends by location through facebook. get a list of friends from your city

FB Sign up logic:
	1. load all friends, 
	2. match on uid & provider in calenshare, 
	3. filter to location, 
	4. filter to not already following

Permissions for access_token on connect

Save FB image? because we are going to see that in the raster - cache it? it would be an HTTP request for each picture! too much.

//////////////////////////////


F T G - scan contacts for users to follow.

Tip by deadline - two hours ahead

subdomains for every city - you can belong to multiple cities -- this strategy can be used for -- should we use heroku if we know our deployment strategy?

text notifications (1 cent per text)

***** Suggestions from Jesse

Map of all events? - hyperlocal NYC thing

dialogue in event#show

tags

Very appealing single-day view

Google Alerts style notifications - different options

copy evite


--------------------General ideas:----------------

user experience of curating invites/groups - don't just select a new type of event
	"Make Current Selection a Group Users" "Invite Group to event"	

Monetization
	Individual deployments (cost based on user limit) (churches, frats, businesses) - pricing?
	Paid RSVPs
	############Premier accounts
	create Paid RSVPs subscription
	Logo icon on event
	preferred search
	personal calendar page (with customizable pretty header picture)

	
Marketing strategy
	private beta? 1001 ppl



---------------------------------------------------


get FB events to show on shalendar

refactor error messages as partial

Lists + Invite Events 

security: recaptcha

add all day boolean

add recurring functionality


library of icons -flush out use cases -sports, games, booze, playdates, 

event types - public, follows, invitation, paid

show details of daily events with this

$(.dayDetails).hide();

$('.day').hover(function(){
	$(this).next('.dayDetails').show();
	},
	$(this).next('.dayDetails').hide();
});

$(.eventDetails).hide();
$('.event').hover(function(){
	$(this)next('.eventDetails').show();
	},
	$(this).next('eventDetails').hide();
});

overlay for new event form could be with a toggle call

$('new_event_button').toggle(function(){
	$(#new_event_form).show(); // with overlay jquery formatting
	},
	$(#new_event_form).hide();
)};


add qTip to event for deets

http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/docs/event_rendering/eventRender/

    eventRender: function(event, element) {
        element.qtip({
            content: event.description
        });
    }


maybe use lyconic's full calendar to get jquery tooltips and limit the number of events per day
