add recurring functionality


show details of daily events with this

$(.dayDetails).hide();

$('.day').hover(function(){
	$(this).next('.dayDetails').show();
	},
	$(this).next('.dayDetails').hide();
});

$(.eventDetails).hide();
$('.event').hover(function(){
	$(this)next('.eventDetails').show();
	},
	$(this).next('eventDetails').hide();
});

overlay for new event form could be with a toggle call

$('new_event_button').toggle(function(){
	$(#new_event_form).show(); // with overlay jquery formatting
	},
	$(#new_event_form).hide();
)};


add qTip to event for deets

http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/docs/event_rendering/eventRender/

    eventRender: function(event, element) {
        element.qtip({
            content: event.description
        });
    }


maybe use lyconic's full calendar to get jquery tooltips and limit the number of events per day
