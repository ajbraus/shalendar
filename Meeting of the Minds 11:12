Meeting of the Minds 11/12

We have two sets of users with different demands

1. Casual Users
	Mobile, 'on the go' reminders, coordination features

2. Venues
	Desktop
	Payments
	brand-positivity

Our new strategy: get venues, who have the pain point of wanting to engage and reach more people, and have them bring their audience with them.
