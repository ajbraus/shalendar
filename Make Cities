Silo by City Plan

Shorter term:

hoos.in Cities are a data structure with a name string and a timezone string

When someone signs up, they select their city. If it's not there, they can request a new city be added. 

hi cities are separate from FB cities, but eventually we'll make a hash that connects the two.

All FB actions (search, invite) are separated by FB city

Events belong to cities
Users belong to cities through city_id, which changes easily based on the dropdown menu.

Invitations (invite all, etc) are silo'd by hoos.in city, but there is a 'globe' image somewhere on screen to make the event/invitations global

Manage friends is tabbed by city

Longer term:
separate DB's by city which split up events, RSVPs, comments and potentially invitations.
One DB that has just users and relationships.
