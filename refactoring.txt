REFACTORING OPPORTUNITIES:

Don't know how to scope an event array, and need to figure out correct SQL calls. Refactor Event Filtering from Ruby->ActiveRecord
	Full + Tipped bool on events model

Don't know how to render the follow button using partials

adding event multiple times to JSON feed if more than one friend is RSVPd... does this matter? fix would be check to see if event is already in maybe array

Index DB on created_at so that the events are actually physically stored next to each other by time

Invites should probably belong to user, bc want an invited? method in user

Events inviter_id only matters when it is served up, and is user-dependent: want a UserEvent subclass (good for mobile too)
