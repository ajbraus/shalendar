APN Notes

Right now, development push notifications working.
Must run redis server 
	(go to place in directory and run ./redis-server if it's on own comp)
	on heroku, it should be launching from config/initializer, but need to test
Must call ./script/apn_sender to send notifications
	seems like this has to happen each time, from a cron job like every 2 mins
Can run APN::Feedback.new from the console to see what it's saying

For now, copied dev certificate into apn_production.pem, but have the real cert in prov/certs folder
