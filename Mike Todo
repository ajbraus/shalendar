--------------- DB / Server -------------

Silo by city **check make cities file in silo_by_city branch
	Put city logic into the events serving methods
	Select city dropdown

DB pruning
	don't make cancel events destroy it, just move it to different table, or just add bool to see if it's still good / over (can do just bool and use it the same for old events)
	Work with scheduler to keep tables manageable for events, invitations, rsvps

Invite only events
	Block anyone else from seeing the event page (just check if their current user has an invitation)

Make it understandable + OVERLY SIMPLE
	?'s next to anything that's ambiguous

Group '?'
	
	With a community idea like this, you can either join the idea as usual or make your own group. If you make a group, we'll make a copy of the idea that you can customize and share with your friends as if it were your own. This way you can have your own meetup beforehand and have your own discussion via comments.

Community Ideas '?'
	
	Above this section you will find only ideas your friends have shared with you. Below, we aggregate creative and adventurous things that people in your community offer for anyone to join.
