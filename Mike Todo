Group '?'
	
	With a community idea like this, you can either join the idea as usual or make your own group. If you make a group, we'll make a copy of the idea that you can customize and share with your friends as if it were your own. This way you can have your own meetup beforehand and have your own discussion via comments.

Community Ideas '?'
