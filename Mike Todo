	Put city logic into the events serving methods
	Select city dropdown

	don't make cancel events destroy it, just move it to different table, or just add bool to see if it's still good / over (can do just bool and use it the same for old events)

How it works:
	hoos.in is here to help you live a creative, adventurous and generally awesome social life. 

	Check your calendar to see what your friends are up to and to find creative ideas for what you can do together. 

	Click on any idea to see who's going, get details and join the fun-or come up with your own idea to add to the mix. Either way, simply click on friends you want to bring along and wait to see who wants to do it with you.

	Either way, decide who you want to invite 

	 find out if your friends want to come too!



Public Ideas '?'
	We fill your hoos.in calendar with great things happening in your city so that anytime you want to do something fun, you know what's going on.
