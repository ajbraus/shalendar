The hoos.in Manifesto 

Here's the deal. There are a lot of people in the world, we're all really connected, and most of us want to lead a kick-ass social life full of creativity and adventure.

That means on any given day, in any city, there are a bunch of people you already know that want to do something great; rock a jam session, host a luau, climb a mountain and watch the sunrise, play pick-up, learn to paint. But for most of us these seem to happen only every once in a while. Why?

People are busy. Coordinating an awesome idea takes a lot of work, and there's nothing that just does it for us. We get home from work drained, and we have to call  have to share it with the right people, plan for numbers, give directions, tell ppl what to bring, collect everyone's share... Pretty soon, our dream of naked feather-pillow-fighting on the rooftop at sunset turns into just another stressful to-do item, and we give up living a mini-adventure every day.

That's a tragedy. A life full of new relationships and experiences makes us healthier, sexier, smarter, happier and just about any other-ier that people generally want. Plus it's good old fashioned fun. So what can we do?

We can remove the hassle and make living an extraordinary social life as ordinary as thick-rimmed glasses on an Apple user. We can leverage technology not for online pseudo-social interaction but to let every busy young professional have the chance to do great things with friends every single day.  

Welcome to a social network that's More Social and Less Network.
