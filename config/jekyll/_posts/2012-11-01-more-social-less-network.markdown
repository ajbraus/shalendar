title: More Social, Less Network

Here's the deal. There are a lot of people in the world, we're pretty connected, and most of us want to lead a kick-ass lifestyle. 

That means on any given day, in any city, there are a bunch of people you already know that want to do something great; rock a jam session, climb a mountain and watch the sunrise, host a luau, play pick-up, learn to paint. But for most of us these aren't our normal nights. Why?

We're busy. Finding a cool idea takes work. Getting a group together and figuring out who wants to join is a hassle (don't forget anyone...) Giving directions and letting people know what to bring is downright tiresome, and collecting everyone's $12 share... forget it. Our awesome dream of feather-pillow fight madness while watching the Knicks courside quickly slips into another stressful pain in the ass. So we skip these daily mini-adventures alltogether.

But that's a tragedy; a social life full of new experience has been shown to benefit health, cognitive function, happiness and just about any other 'good' thing folks know how to measure. Plus it's good ol' fashioned fun. So what can we do?

We think the answer's simple - to leverage technology not facilitate real life activites, not replace them. To remove the hassle and make living an extraordinary social life . . . normal. To let every busy person still do great things with friends any day they want.  

Welcome to a social network that's More Social and Less Network.
