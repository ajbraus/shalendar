### Specs

The spec suite is a work in progress.  Existing specs can either be run
using [guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) or rake.

Guard

    $ bundle exec guard

Rake

    $ rake spec

We use [VCR](https://www.relishapp.com/myronmarston/vcr/docs) to stub
out and save http interactions.  Cassettes are not stored in the repo.
They are generated the first time the spec suite is run and stored in
spec/cassettes.  To clear them and regenerate:

    $ rm -rf spec/cassettes


### Building Documentation

Documentation is built using YARD - http://rubydoc.info/docs/yard
 
    export AMAZON_ACCESS_KEY_ID='xxx'
    export AMAZON_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='yyy' 
    ./upload_docs.rb
