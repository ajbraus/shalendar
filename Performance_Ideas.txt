PERFORMANCE OPPORTUNITIES:

visibility as integer
SQL queries events_on_date
javascript not hitting server 
	serve all events in forecast and just hide and show based on which users are toggled


	Event
		set data-user-id => data-inviter-id and remake ajax


REFACTORING OPPORTUNITIES:

Index DB on created_at so that the events are actually physically stored next to each other by time

Events inviter_id only matters when it is served up, and is user-dependent: want a UserEvent subclass (good for mobile too)
