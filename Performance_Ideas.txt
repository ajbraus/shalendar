PERFORMANCE OPPORTUNITIES:

Separate calls for manage_follows and shalendar for relationships#create (maybe something to do with :back symbol)
SQL queries events_on_date
javascript not hitting server 
	serve all events in forecast and just hide and show based on which users are toggled

Searching invitations in invited? call through all invitations.. can we change it to event.invitations.where() call instead to scope it?
	Event
		set data-user-id => data-inviter-id and remake ajax

REFACTORING OPPORTUNITIES:

Index DB on created_at so that the events are actually physically stored next to each other by time

Events inviter_id only matters when it is served up, and is user-dependent: want a UserEvent subclass (good for mobile too)

MINOR IMPROVEMENTS:
use hash for all notifier stuff instead of finding by id at start
